Welcome to **PersonalWebsite_SKaim**, my first personal website! 🌿✨  
This is **Version 1.0**, and I aim to improve both the aesthetics (aligning it more with my early 2000s indie web vision) and the content.

## 🔮 Planned Improvements
- Improve website styling to enhance the **early 2000s aesthetic**.
- Make the **Table of Contents (TOC) non-overlapping** and more responsive.
- Fix **video upload issues** (currently facing compression limitations, so I'll be hosting them externally).
- Add **more interactive elements**, animations, and dynamic content.

## ⚡ Current Issues
- **Table of Contents (TOC) overlaps the main text** on certain screen sizes.
- **Videos are not uploading properly** despite compression—I'll move to external hosting for now.
- The setup is not mobile friendly.
- Theview counter is not updating.
