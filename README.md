# [PersonalWebsite_SKaim](https://soumyakaim.github.io/PersonalWebsite_SKaim/)

Welcome to **PersonalWebsite_SKaim**, my first personal website! 🌿✨  
This is **Version 1.0**, and I aim to improve both the aesthetics (aligning it more with my early 2000s indie web vision) and the content.

## 🔮 Planned Improvements
- Improve website styling to enhance the **early 2000s aesthetic**.
- Make the **Table of Contents (TOC) non-overlapping** and more responsive.
- Fix **video upload issues** (currently facing compression limitations, so I'll be hosting them externally (aka YT)).
- Add **more interactive elements**, animations, and dynamic content.

## ⚡ Current Issues
- **Table of Contents (TOC) overlaps the main text** on certain screen sizes.
- The setup is not mobile friendly.
- The view counter is not updating. Removed it for now, I will come back to it later.
- The pixie dust effect is not workiing even thought it works when I run the script via VScode.
