Welcome to **PersonalWebsite_SKaim**, my first personal website! 🌿✨  
This is **Version 1.0**, and I aim to improve both the aesthetics (aligning it more with my early 2000s indie web vision) and the content.

## 🔮 Planned Improvements
- Improve website styling to enhance the **early 2000s aesthetic**.
- Make the **menu bar non-overlapping** and more responsive in mobile version. 
- Add **more interactive elements**, animations, and dynamic content.
- Add more pictures and videos relevant to my work (both research and skills section) to make reading easy. I'm not a fan huge text blocks one after the other.
- Reduce the Education section into fun nuggets of info. 

## ⚡ Current Issues
- **Menu bar overlaps the main text** on certain screen sizes.
- The setup is not mobile friendly.
- The view counter is not updating. Removed it for now, I will come back to it later.
- Certain images and videos do not play randomly. I dont know why and dont know how to fix it, yet.
