            <p> My expertise in statistical analysis spans advanced methodologies, including hypothesis testing, regression modelling, and mltivariate analysis, applied to both behvaioural and neuropsychological research. In a study on social behvaiour in Drosophila melanogaster, I employed two-way ANOVA to assess the impact of genetic variation has on socialization patterns and sleep cycles, demonstrating how environemtn and genetic factors contribute to behvaioural regulation. I used multivariate analysis to study the effects of sensorimotor confusion on auditory perception. Throughout these projects, I have leveraged statistical software, including SPSS, R, JASP, and Python (Statsmodels, SciPy), to conduct rigorous data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, ensuring reproducibility and methodological rigor in my analyses.</p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Neuroimaging Techniques</h1>
            <p>My expertise in neuroimaging focuses on EEG signal processing, event-related potential (ERP) analysis, and artifact rejection techniques for both EEG and fNIRS data. In my major thesis, I conducted an EEG-based study on auditory hallucinations, examining how sensorimotor conflicts influence auditory processing. This project involved the use of a robotic system to induce mismatched sensory feedback, allowing for the investigation of neural correlates underlying perceptual distortions. Additionally, I performed a meta-analysis of ERP studies to synthesize findings on response inhibition and impulsivity, integrating data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of cognitive control mechanisms. Beyond empirical research, I have also contributed to methodological advancements by developing Python-based automation pipelines for EEG preprocessing. These scripts streamlined bandpass filtering, independent component analysis (ICA), and artifact detection, significantly improving the efficiency and reproducibility of EEG data analysis. My proficiency in neuroimaging tools such as MNE-Python, EEGLAB (MATLAB), and FieldTrip has enabled me to conduct sophisticated neural data analyses while ensuring methodological rigor and reproducibility in cognitive neuroscience research. </p>

        <section id="Programming">
            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Programming and Analysis</h1>
            <p> My expertise in programming and data analysis primarily revolves around Python, with a strong focus on data preprocessing, EEG/ERP signal processing, and statistical modeling. In the context of neuroimaging research, I developed an automated EEG/ERP preprocessing pipeline, implementing custom Python scripts to clean, segment, and analyze neural data. This approach minimized manual errors, improved reproducibility, and facilitated large-scale data processing. Additionally, my work in behavioral research involved writing Python scripts to analyze false positive rates, accuracy, precision, and response times in cognitive tasks, ensuring robust statistical evaluation of experimental results. Beyond human neuroscience, I applied computational methodologies to behavioral tracking in Drosophila melanogaster, where I designed custom algorithms to process over 1,638 hours of movement data. These algorithms extracted complex behavioral patterns, including social interaction metrics and locomotion differences, contributing to a deeper understanding of genetic influences on behavior. This not only benefitted me but also contributed to published research. My technical proficiency extends to working with scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for statistical modeling and visualization, as well as specialized neuroimaging tools like MNE-Python for EEG analysis and TREX for drosophila behavior tracking. Through these projects, I have demonstrated the ability to integrate computational techniques into neuroscience research, improving data processing efficiency and enhancing analytical rigor.</p>

        <!-- Behavioural research -->
        <section id="Behavioural">
            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Behavioural Research</h1>
            <p> My expertise in behavioral research encompasses cognitive task design, psychometric assessments, and behavioral tracking across both human and animal models. In clinical psychology, I administered and analyzed personality and cognitive function tests for over 150 participants in a study examining the relationship between substance abuse, emotional regulation, and alexithymia. This work involved rigorous psychometric evaluation to differentiate clinical from non-clinical populations. In the domain of animal behavior, I designed and implemented a large-scale tracking study on Drosophila melanogaster, creating a comprehensive social interaction matrix from 68 days of continuous movement data. This project provided insights into the effects of genetic variation on social behavior and sleep patterns. Additionally, I conducted Signal Detection Test (SDT) where a robot was used to artificially induce sensorimotor confusion and particiapnts' accuracy, precision and false positive rate were measured using EEG-based. These experiments required precise stimulus presentation, real-time behavioral recording, and advanced data analysis. My methodological proficiency includes the use of TREX for automated fly tracking, PsychoPy for cognitive task programming, and Python for stimulus presentation. By integrating psychometric testing with experimental behavioral paradigms, I have contributed to a multidisciplinary understanding of cognition, emotion, and behavior.</p>

            <p> My work in research automation and methodological innovation has focused on developing computational tools to enhance data analysis, improve reproducibility, and streamline experimental workflows. In neuroimaging research, I designed a Python-based automated analysis pipeline for EEG signal processing, enabling faster and more scalable data preprocessing, artifact rejection, and statistical analysis (github link). In behavioral neuroscience, I developed a Drosophila social analysis toolkit that introduced a novel, non-intrusive method for extracting social interaction data from long-term behavioral recordings. This innovation significantly improved research accuracy and efficiency (Github link). Additionally, in cognitive neuroscience, I created custom scripts to automate neurocognitive task analyses, facilitating the extraction of reaction times, error rates, and neural correlates in cognitive experiments.</p>
                
            <p>Beyond research-specific automation, I have contributed practical tools to optimize workflows for researchers. I developed an NPZ-to-CSV converter to simplify data handling for Drosophila movement tracking in TREX, making it easier for my lab and other researchers to process and analyze behavioral datasets (). Furthermore, I designed a schematic for the optimal placement of electrooculography (EOG) electrodes to facilitate a clearer understanding of electrode positioning (). This schematic serves as a practical reference for both new and experienced researchers during EEG experiments, ensuring accurate signal acquisition. My methodological contributions emphasize research automation, efficiency, and accessibility, leveraging tools such as Python, GitHub, and the Open Science Framework to enhance data analysis pipelines and experimental reproducibility.</p>
