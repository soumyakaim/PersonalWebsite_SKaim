    <p>üëã Hello! I‚Äôm <strong>Soumya Kaim</strong>, and I like figuring out how brains (and people) work. 
    Currently, I'm a master's student at the <strong>University of Groningen (RUG, The Netherlands)</strong>, applying for exciting PhD positions in neuroscience with a focus on neuroimaging.</p>

    <div class="box"><h3>üéì Educational Background</h3></div>

    <div class="education-entry">
        <h4>Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Applied Psychology</h4>
        <p><strong>University of Delhi (SPMC) ‚Äì New Delhi, India</strong></p>
        <p>Graduated with a CGPA of <strong>7.608 (First Class)</strong> and earned the <strong>NCC ‚ÄúC‚Äù Certificate</strong>. 
        My thesis focused on <em>Alexithymia in alcohol dependency addiction</em>, essentially exploring why some people drink their feelings instead of expressing them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="education-entry">
        <h4>Master of Science in Clinical Psychology</h4>
        <p><strong>National Forensic Sciences University ‚Äì Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India</strong></p>
        <p>Graduated with a CPI of <strong>8.12 (First Class with Distinction)</strong>. My thesis examined 
        <em>Lateralization, response inhibition, and impulsivity in response to emotional images and scenes</em>, proving that emotions mess with our brains more than we think‚Äîscience says so.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="education-entry">
        <h4>Master of Science (Research Master) in Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience</h4>
        <p><strong>University of Groningen (The Netherlands) ‚Äì Cognition & Cognitive Modelling (BCN, C-track)</strong></p>
        <p>Currently pursuing my research master's in neuroscience with a strong emphasis on neuroimaging. My research includes:</p>
        <p><strong>Minor Thesis:</strong> Socialization and sleep in fruit flies. (Yes, I watched flies sleep for science.)</p>
        <p><strong>Major Thesis:</strong> Inducing auditory hallucinations using a robot. (Making brains question reality, one experiment at a time.)</p>
        <p>Additionally, I have been actively involved as a <strong>Program Committee and Student Council Member</strong> for my enrolled track.</p>

    <div class="research-entry">
        <h3 class="research-title">üß† Major Thesis: Inducing Auditory Hallucinations</h3>
        <p>This study investigates how sensorimotor confusion influences auditory hallucinations. A robotic arm delivers tactile stimulation to the participant‚Äôs back while they perform a Signal-Detection Task (SDT) using a joystick.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The experiment integrates EEG and fNIRS to track neural activity during sensorimotor disruptions. I developed custom Python scripts for behavioral analysis, including false positive rates, accuracy, and precision. This research contributes to understanding how sensorimotor feedback mismatches influence perception and the neural basis of hallucinations.</p>

    <!-- Minor Thesis -->
    <div class="research-entry">
        <h3 class="research-title">ü™∞ Minor Thesis: Do Flies Need Friends?</h3>
        <p>This study explores the impact of genetic variation on social behavior and sleep regulation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Using Canton-S (CS) and Oregon-R (OR) fruit fly strains, I collected and analyzed 1,638+ hours (68 days) of continuous movement data in custom-built social arenas.</p>
        
        <p>Findings showed that CS flies exhibited 27.39% more social interactions and 34.5% higher sleep duration compared to OR flies. Both strains demonstrated a 9.8% reduction in social interaction and sleep during the light phase compared to the dark phase, but locomotion remained unchanged. The study contributes to our understanding of how genetics influence social behavior and circadian regulation.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>This research, published in <i>Molecular Psychiatry</i>, examines the role of the human neuropsychiatric risk gene <i>Drd2</i> in social behavior across species. The study integrates computational analysis and experimental neurobiology to provide cross-species evidence of <i>Drd2</i>'s role in behavior regulation.</p>
        
        <p>My contributions included developing custom Python scripts to analyze over 500 minutes of social interaction data from more than 50 biological samples. Additionally, I managed key experimental logistics, including fruit fly handling, sample collection, and dataset validation.</p>
